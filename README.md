Prophet is an open-source prediction market arbitrage bot designed to automatically scan multiple platforms (such as Polymarket and Kalshi) for price discrepancies and execute risk-free trades to capture guaranteed profit opportunities.

The bot features real-time market data ingestion, opportunity detection algorithms, automated trade execution, and robust risk management.

Prophet is modular, extensible, and includes logging, analytics, and a dashboard for monitoring bot performance. Ideal for developers interested in algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, and prediction market research.
